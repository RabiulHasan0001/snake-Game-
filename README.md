The game ends if the snake hits the walls or collides with itself.
Press 'C' to play again after losing or 'Q' to quit the game.
Instructions:

Install Pygame by running pip install pygame in your terminal.
Execute the script, and the game window will appear.
Control the snake with arrow keys and enjoy the challenge!
